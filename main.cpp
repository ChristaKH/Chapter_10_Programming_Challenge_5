 * Problem Statement: Pie A La Mode - In statistics the mode of a set of values is the value that occurs
 * the most often. Write a program that determines how many pieces of pie most people eat in a year.Set
 * up an integer array that can hold responses from 30 people. For each person, enter the number of pieces
 * they say they eat in the year. Then write a function that finds the mode of these 30 values. This will
 * be the number of pie slices eaten by the most people. The function that finds and returns the mode should
 * accept two arguments, an array of integers, and a value indicating how many elements are in the array.
